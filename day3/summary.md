# Fun score
Never enjoyed writing C.  I just don't like it.  3/10.

## Practical score
Marginally some more use cases than asm, stuff that needs to be closer to the metal than normal high level languages but not as close as asm - maybe games?  3/10. 
  
## Why learn C?
If you want to write games or code that needs to be really fast and you don't want to write it in asm.
