# Fun score
Go is fun, but I think I got a little negative because I messed up on the second part and was not satisfied with my solution - it works, it just seems like a non elegant solution.  The language looks like something in between c, pascal and some scripting language, and I like the simplicity even though you don't get as much for free as in some of the other scripting languages I have tested.  6/10.

## Practical score
It seems to me to a perfect language for those who want to write C but hate C.  Which kind of suits me.  You get a lot of flexibility and some nice solutions to programming problems, but then you loose some of the built in functionality of scripting languages.  I would not consider go for a small scripting job, but if you have a large project which should be maintained it looks great.  7/10.

## Why learn Go?
Because everyone learns go these days.
