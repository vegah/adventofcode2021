# Fun score
This looks and feels like Python and Ruby and Julia.  Never used it before, but probably will use it again. Really great documentation, and a fun puzzle where part 2 probably have an easier solution.  8/10.  

## Practical score
All around great programming language that can solve most problems you face.  A very powerful tool for quick and small projects without much boilerplate or overhead.  To me it seems better documented than both Julia and Ruby, and I will certainly look more into this gem!  8/10  

## Why learn Crystal?
Because you really like Ruby, but want something that feels a little newer and maybe even better.
