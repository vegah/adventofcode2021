# Fun score
Perl bring back some nostalgia, it was the first language I used in a professional sense.  It's a language that helps you, both to solve problems and to shoot your self in the foot.  7/10  
  
## Practical score
Most problems can be solved with Perl, even though it has gone a little out of fashion.  To where it really shines are simple text parsing jobs. 5/10  

## Why learn Perl?
Because it is fun, and you could probably solve the Israel-Palestina conflict in one unreadable Perl line.
