# Fun score
Smalltalk was completely new for me, so the code looks like trash and I spent some time writing the code.  On the other hand, this was a language that triggered my curiosity.  From what I read, and from what I can understand, it implements OO in a really nice way.  I was not able to fully implement it like it should, but I will spend more time researching this language.  And it was fun.  7/10.  
  
## Practical score
This seems like a very general language, and according to what I can read it scores high on productivity.  I can not see that Smalltalk is a bad choice for any projects, but my *impression* is that it maybe misses some standard packages etc.  It also have some dialects that aren't 100% compatible. 6/10    
  
## Why learn Smalltalk?
From my short impression it looks like a great introduction to OO design.  (But as I said, my code kind of breaks those principles anyways :)
