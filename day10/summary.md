# Fun score
Rust seems like an elegant go, or even more like an elegant c.  The iterator concept works really well, and it was really fun trying rust for the first time.  I probably will need some time to adjust myself completely to rust, but I probably will look more into this for certain type of applications.  7/10.

## Practical score
I think this competes with go, c and c# for more complex projects and not so much for solving pretty simple puzzles.  That said, it is full of functionality to solve just these puzzles, so this could be me being a little prejudiced against a language that looks this much like c.  7/10.

## Why learn Rust?
It seems like c with seatbelts, which isn't a bad thing.
