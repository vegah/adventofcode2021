# Fun score
Ruby gives you a lot of built in functions to traverse arrays etc, so it was a natural choice (but quite random) for this puzzle.  So far the only puzzle I have solved with the exact same code in both instances - but that is a little because of the puzzle too.  Fun to work with, easy to use - what's not to like?  8/10.  

## Practical score
All around great programming language that can solve most problems you face.  A very powerful tool for quick and small projects without much boilerplate or overhead.  7/10  

## Why learn Ruby?
Because it is fun, easy to use and it looks nice!
