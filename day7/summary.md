# Fun score
This looks and feels like Python and Ruby.  Never used it before, but probably will use it again.  Easy to use for small puzzles, at least - lots of built in functionality which makes it fun and easy.  8/10.  

## Practical score
All around great programming language that can solve most problems you face.  A very powerful tool for quick and small projects without much boilerplate or overhead.  7/10  

## Why learn Julia?
Because it is fun, easy to use and it looks nice! (Yes, same as for Ruby)
