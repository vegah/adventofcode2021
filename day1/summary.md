## Fun score
Great fun, nostalgia - 10/10  
  
## Practical score
Unless you are writing an operating system or maybe system drivers or you are writing for some special embedded system, I can not see any practical use for ARM assembly.  2/10  
  
## Why learn ARM assembly?
There are two advantages I can think of:  
1)  Asm are pretty easy to learn, because the number of instructions are few.  Sure, you need more than 2 minutes to learn "Hello world", but at the same time you probably understand a lot more of the language itself when you actually can write "Hello world".  
2)  Asm give you an understanding of computers actually "think".  For example, since bits are so integrated in how processors work, you probably will have some more understanding of bitwise operators (OR, AND, XOR, NOT) and maybe also the same logical operators.  

That said, unless you are interested in learning ASM I don't think it will give you anything you can not get from a lot of other languages.
