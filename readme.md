# Advent of code using a different programming language each day
A challenge:  Use 1 different programming language for each day of [Advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).  
The main problem is that code you program one day is used the next day, so this will probably end up in rewriting a lot of code, and I am under no illusion that I will be done by christmas.  But sometime in 2022 I should be able to complete it.  Maybe

## Disclaimer
Solving small puzzles in languages that I don't necessarily know is of course not the best way to judge a programming language, this is a very subjective rating of programming languages based on how much fun _I_ had when using them, and if _I_ could see any practical purpose for the language.
